      "\n",
      "Our biggest issue lately is sleep. We let our oldest stay up later because she has more homework to do. She usually goes to bed about 9:30 pm on school nights. We try to get the younger two in bed by 8 pm, although it normally ends up closer to 8:30 pm most nights. We don’t have any scheduled bedtime for the weekends, and the older two sleep pretty late on weekend mornings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is getting them up in the morning on school days. We start waking them up about 6 am. They are all hard to wake, especially our teenager. She has to be on the bus by a little before 7 am, and she always seems exhausted.\n",

      "Dear Mom of Sleepy Kids,\n",
      "\n",
      "Your questions are great ones. Sleep-related issues can be challenging for parents and children, so I decided to get some expert information. I looked at a number of sources during my research, and they all seemed to be in agreement about the amount of sleep time that children of different ages require. The most concise answer came from Dr. Rachel Dawkins* at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital, and I’m including her information for children of all ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Dawkins, adequate sleep is critical for children’s overall health and wellness. The right amount of sleep improves children’s memory, attention, behavior, learning, and general mental and physical health. Conversely, a lack of sleep can lead to obesity, high blood pressure and possibly depression in children and teens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dawkins offers these guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding the recommended amount of sleep for children by age:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Infants younger than 1 year: 12-16 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "• Children 1-2 years old: 11-14 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "• Children 3-5 years old: 10-13 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "• Children 6-12 years old: 9-12 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "• Teenagers 13-18 years old: 8-10 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "You didn’t mention whether your children have trouble going to sleep or staying asleep, but those issues can factor into how much sleep they’re actually getting and how easily they’re able to wake up in the morning. It’s also important to keep in mind that each child is different, and some need more or less sleep than the recommended guidelines.\n"

      "It's important to note that each child is different, and some may need more or less sleep than the recommended guidelines. In addition to getting enough sleep, it's also beneficial to have a consistent sleep schedule for your children, even on the weekends. While it's okay to stay up an hour later and sleep in an hour later, maintaining a regular sleep routine helps promote quality sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your child is having trouble going to sleep or staying asleep, it may impact the amount of sleep they're actually getting and how easily they're able to wake up in the morning. Implementing a bedtime routine can be helpful, such as ending screen time an hour before bedtime, reading together, dimming the lights, and encouraging warm showers or baths before bed. It's also recommended to discourage snacks right before bedtime and limit caffeinated drinks to daytime hours only.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your child continues to struggle with waking up, especially your teenager, it may be beneficial for them to increase their hours of sleep. Encouraging them to get homework done earlier and go to bed earlier can help. If their exhaustion persists, it may be necessary to consult with their pediatrician.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to focusing on sleep, including age-appropriate physical activities in your child's routine can also improve their sleep quality. 30 minutes of indoor or outdoor exercise can go a long way in helping them sleep on time. It's important to avoid strenuous physical activity right before bedtime, as it can make them overtired and lead to increased sleeplessness. If your child experiences persistent sleeping troubles, it may be necessary to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea. Seeking professional medical advice can help with proper diagnosis and timely treatment if needed.\n"
